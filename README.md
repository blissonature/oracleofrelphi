# ✧ Oracle of Relphi — Static Site Framework

A foundational scaffold for the Oracle of Relphi website — a Saturnian architecture designed to hold doctrine, tools, memory systems, harmonic geometry, and the unfolding oracular engines of the Relphi cosmology.

- Veilva, Divulva, limma, δ, emergence geometry
- Lineage entanglement maps

### tools.html
Hub for all interactive Relphi tools.

### harmonics.html
Placeholder for the Harmonics Temple:
- compass-and-straightedge geometric constructions
- harmonic division engines
- Veilva ascent overlays
- δ/circle ratios

### mnemo.html
Placeholder for Mnemo:
- memory palace architecture
- icons, anchors, rooms, retrieval paths
- dream debugging integration

### tarot.html
Placeholder for Tarot Weaver:
- spreads
- reversals
- elemental/court-matrix logic
- relational readings

### gematria.html
Placeholder for the Gematria/Harmonics Engine:
- harmonic reductions
- sidereal month multipliers
- 1–5–6–5 pattern
- 1228:263 emergence pathway

### practice.html

## ✧ Purpose

This scaffold lets you:
- build slowly without overwhelm
- keep navigation consistent
- integrate dynamic applets later
- maintain a coherent Relphi architecture

Each page is a chamber awaiting its living breath.
