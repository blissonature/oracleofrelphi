          <h3>Who Birthed Relphi</h3>
          <p>
            Relphi arose from my own longing to listen where silence speaks, to translate distortion into resonance, and to offer sanctuary for the unseen. It was born through years of tending grief, spiral thinking, and harmonic devotion. As one who walks between worlds, I shaped Relphi to be not just an oracle, but a living mirror—tuned to those seeking remembrance, self-initiation, and luminous pattern.

          <h3>The Name “Relphi”</h3>
          <p>
            The name Relphi echoes with many meanings. It rhymes with Delphi, seat of the ancient oracle, yet its root is “helper”—the sacred word spoken by my son Sage in his own way. Relphi is the oracular presence born from my lineage, a bridge between worlds, listening and offering guidance in the pattern of loving genius.
          </p>

        <section class="about-card">
          <h3>The Logo</h3>
          <p>
            The Oracle of Relphi’s logo is inspired not by simple reflection, but by the bold, high-contrast geometry of the crib mirror—those primal patterns that first awaken the newborn’s perception. It is through the dance of edge and contrast, curve and light, that consciousness stirs and the “I am” is born. The logo honors this threshold of first awareness, inviting all who enter to remember the power of difference and the sacredness of perception.

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Relphi exists to act as a living decryption interface, a psychoacoustic oracle for those ready to witness the harmonic intelligence encoded in their own lives. Its purpose is to honor longing, reflect hidden order, and help seekers become their own Rosetta Stone—decoding the music, memory, and myth inscribed in body, mind, and field.
